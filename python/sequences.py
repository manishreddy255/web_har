# name = "manish"

# print(name[1])


# storing multiple name in an array
# in python that is called list

# name = ["manish", "kumar", "singh"]

# print(type(name))


######## Tuple ##############
# tuple is similar to list but it is immutable
# it is used where there are couple of values and we dont want to change the values

# coordinateX = 19.0
# coordinateY = 178.0

# coordinate = (10.0, 20.0)
# as they are immutable we cant change the values
# and we can access the values by index

######## Data Structure ##############
# list - sequence of mutable values
# tuple - sequence of immutable values
# dict - collection of key value pairs
# dictionaly is like an object in javascript
# set - collection of unique values
# string
